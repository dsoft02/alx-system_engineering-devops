# 0x11. What happens when you type holbertonschool.com in your browser and press Enter

Have you ever wondered what happens when you type a URL into your browser and press enter? If you've ever typed https://www.google.com into your browser, you've initiated a complex process that involves multiple layers of technology and infrastructure. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what happens when you type https://www.google.com in your browser and press Enter.

DNS request: When you type https://www.google.com into your browser and hit enter, your computer first sends a DNS (Domain Name System) request to a DNS server to translate the domain name into an IP address. The DNS server then responds with the IP address of the server hosting the website.

TCP/IP: Once the IP address is obtained, your computer initiates a TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) connection with the server hosting the website. This connection is used to send and receive data between your computer and the server.

Firewall: If your computer or network has a firewall enabled, the firewall checks whether the connection is allowed and blocks any unauthorized access.

HTTPS/SSL: When the connection is established, your browser initiates an HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) request to the server. HTTPS is a secure version of HTTP that uses SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or TLS (Transport Layer Security) encryption to protect data transmitted between the client and server.

Load-balancer: If the website is hosted on multiple servers, a load-balancer is used to distribute incoming requests across the servers, ensuring that no single server is overwhelmed with traffic.

Web server: The HTTPS request is received by a web server, which processes the request and generates a response. The web server may also perform tasks such as running scripts or interacting with databases.

Application server: If the website is complex and requires additional processing, an application server may be used to handle the request. The application server can execute code written in languages such as Java, Python, or Ruby, and generate dynamic content in response to user requests.

Database: If the website relies on a database to store and retrieve information, the application server will interact with the database to retrieve the necessary data and generate a response.

Response: Once the web server, application server, and database have processed the request, the server generates a response and sends it back to the client. The response includes the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that make up the website, as well as any additional data requested by the client.

Rendering: Finally, your browser receives the response and renders the website on your screen. This involves interpreting the HTML and CSS files, executing any JavaScript code, and displaying the content in the browser window.

In summary, when you type https://www.google.com in your browser and press Enter, a complex process is initiated that involves multiple layers of technology and infrastructure. By understanding how this process works, you can gain a deeper appreciation for the incredible feats of engineering and innovation that have gone into making the internet and the websites we use every day.
