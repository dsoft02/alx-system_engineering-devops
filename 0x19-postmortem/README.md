Postmortem: Apache Error Outage ( 0x17. Web stack debugging #3)

**Issue Summary:**
Duration: May 10, 2023, 15:30 - May 10, 2023, 17:45 (UTC)
Impact: Our beloved Apache service stumbled upon its own feet, resulting in a widespread 500 error circus show. Users were left hanging in frustration as their requests fell into the abyss of internal server errors.
**Timeline:**
- 15:30: Panic mode engaged! Monitoring alerts went berserk, unleashing an army of HTTP 500 error messages upon us.
- Actions taken: Our courageous team embarked on a thrilling investigation, exploring the mystical realms of Apache and diving deep into log files and server metrics to uncover the hidden culprit.
- Misleading investigation paths: Our initial suspects included mischievous code gremlins and slippery database connections. Alas, the truth eluded us, and these paths led to dead-ends like a labyrinth of illusions.
- Escalation: As the enigma persisted, we summoned the wise senior infrastructure team to join our quest for answers.
- Resolution: At the stroke of 17:45, victory was within reach! We unveiled the true villain - a mischievous typo lurking within the sacred Apache configuration file. With a swift correction and a sprinkle of puppet magic, the correct module was summoned, and Apache roared back to life, leaving the 500 errors in its dust.
**Root Cause and Resolution:**
The root cause of the Apache error outbreak was a wicked misconfiguration in the Apache configuration file. A single mischievous typo led to a faulty module loading, unleashing the dreaded 500 internal server errors upon innocent users. But fear not! We banished the gremlin responsible by:
- Correcting the typo in the Apache configuration file using the powerful enchantment of Puppet, ensuring the right module was summoned.
- Deploying the corrected configuration with grace and elegance.
- Restarting Apache, breathing new life into the service and restoring the sweet harmony of a functioning web stack.
**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**
To fortify our web stack against future mischief, we shall embark on a quest to bolster our defenses and enhance our resilience:
1. Quest for Configuration Vigilance: Establish a monthly ritual of reviewing critical configuration files, including Apache, to unveil lurking gremlins.
 - Task: Assemble a fellowship of engineers for the monthly configuration review, armed with keen eyes and magnifying glasses.
2. Enchantment of Configuration Validation: Implement pre-deployment validation spells to safeguard against misconfigurations.
 - Task: Enchant our deployment process with automated validation of Apache configurations before unleashing changes upon the realm.
3. Battle-Tested Automated Guards: Fortify our testing pipeline with automated tests that wield the power to detect module loading anomalies.
 - Task: Bestow upon our CI/CD pipeline the sacred gift of automated tests for Apache configurations.
4. Oracle of Centralized Logging and Monitoring: Channel the wisdom of centralized logging and monitoring to swiftly detect and unmask hidden errors within the web stack.
 - Task: Enhance our logging and monitoring solutions to alert us when Apache's tranquility is disturbed by internal server errors.
5. Heroes' Training Ground: Sharpen our incident response skills through regular training and exercises, equipping every team member with the tools to battle adversity.
 - Task: Organize quarterly incident response training sessions, where we shall face virtual gremlins and overcome simulated challenges.
By embarking on these measures, we shall fortify our web stack, shield it from misconfigurations, and stand
